    \label{section:abstract}

    Object detection has been a major topic of image understanding and deep learning in general for many years now. Different applications of object detection are possible, like vehicle detection in autonomous driving or people counting at an event. Most applications require fast detection of the objects in a given image. \\

    In the present work, we implement such an object detector. Single Shot MultiBox Detector (in short: SSD) delivers great precision while being faster than other neural networks. We discuss two different types of the SSD network, one for images of size $300 \times 300$ and the other one for images of size $512 \times 512$.
