\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

We can see that the theory behind the Single Shot MultiBox Detector has proven to be a valid and successful fundament for an object detection network. Next to a good precision the network provides a lightweight model structure that allows fast inference. \\

During the implementation of this project, we have seen that there are some possibilities to improve the training results of this work. One of the points would be to use a different optimizer and a more elegant way to decay the learning rate. Another way is to improve the data augmentation to expand the dataset. \\

Overall, the project has given us a great introduction into object detection and the different ways how to tackle the problem.
